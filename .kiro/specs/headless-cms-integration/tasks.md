##
 Integration Guidelines

**Preserving Existing Project:**
- All new routes will use prefixes: `/auth/*`, `/dashboard/*`, `/admin/*`, `/news/*`
- CMS functionality will be completely isolated from existing features
- Existing CSS classes, themes, and design systems will be reused for consistency
- No modifications to existing pages, components, or functionality
- New Convex project ensures complete separation from existing backend
- Environment variables will be additive, not replacing existing configuration

**Design Consistency:**
- Match existing typography, colors, and spacing
- Reuse existing component patterns and layouts
- Maintain existing navigation structure (add CMS links where appropriate)
- Preserve existing user experience and workflows
- Use existing CSS framework/methodology (Tailwind, CSS modules, etc.)

**Deployment Safety:**
- CMS features can be deployed incrementally without affecting existing functionality
- Rollback capability for each feature without impacting existing site
- Separate database (Convex) ensures no data conflicts
- Independent service dependencies (Sanity) for content management
