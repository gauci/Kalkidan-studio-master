# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive headless CMS solution using a new Convex project for backend functionality and Sanity CMS for content management. The system will provide user authentication, file management capabilities, and an admin interface for content creation without requiring code changes. The architecture is designed to be migration-friendly for potential future transitions to other platforms like Firebase.

3. WHEN a registered user enters correct credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and provide access to protected areas
4. WHEN a user enters incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and deny access
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page when accessing protected routes
6. WHEN an authenticated user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the public area

### Requirement 2: File Upload and Download System

6. WHEN a user deletes a file THEN the system SHALL remove it from storage and update their file list
7. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages explaining the issue

### Requirement 3: Admin Content Management System

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to create and manage news articles, images, and files through an intuitive interface, so that I can update website content without touching code.

5. IF a non-admin user tries to access Sanity Studio THEN the system SHALL deny access
6. WHEN an admin schedules content THEN the system SHALL publish it at the specified time
7. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes on the website in real-time

### Requirement 4: Public Content Display

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to view published news articles and media content, so that I can stay informed about updates and announcements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses the news section THEN the system SHALL display published articles in chronological order

6. WHEN a visitor searches for content THEN the system SHALL return relevant results based on title and content

### Requirement 5: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control user permissions and access levels, so that I can maintain security and proper content management workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user account is created THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate default permissions
2. WHEN an admin promotes a user THEN the system SHALL update their permissions and notify them
3. IF a user tries to access unauthorized areas THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
4. WHEN user roles are changed THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce new permissions
5. WHEN an admin views user management THEN the system SHALL display current roles and permissions clearly
6. IF an admin account is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to revoke access quickly

### Requirement 6: Build and Deployment Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build and deploy successfully without errors, so that users can access the platform reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built for production THEN the system SHALL compile without "self is not defined" errors
2. WHEN React components are rendered THEN the system SHALL not throw "Objects are not valid as a React child" errors
3. WHEN Convex is integrated THEN the system SHALL handle server-side rendering properly
4. WHEN the application is deployed to Vercel THEN the system SHALL start without runtime errors
5. IF build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution steps
6. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with helpful messages

### Requirement 7: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data and files to be secure and private, so that I can trust the platform with sensitive information.
