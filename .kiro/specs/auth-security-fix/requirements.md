# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security vulnerabilities in the authentication and authorization system where unauthorized users can see admin interface elements and registered user information. The system currently shows logout buttons and admin navigation to users who shouldn't have access, creating a serious security risk.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected areas, so that sensitive information remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access admin routes THEN the system SHALL immediately redirect them to the login page without showing any admin interface elements
2. WHEN an authenticated user without admin privileges attempts to access admin routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their dashboard without showing admin interface elements
3. WHEN the authentication state is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator and NOT render any protected content
4. WHEN authentication fails or expires THEN the system SHALL immediately clear all user data and redirect to login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the system to properly handle authentication state transitions, so that no sensitive information is leaked during loading or error states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is loading authentication state THEN the system SHALL NOT render any user-specific content or navigation elements
2. WHEN authentication state changes from authenticated to unauthenticated THEN the system SHALL immediately clear all displayed user information
3. WHEN there is an authentication error THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without exposing system details
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out and redirect to login

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a regular user, I want to see appropriate login/register buttons when I'm not authenticated, so that I can access the system properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL display login and register buttons in the navigation
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their name and logout button in the navigation
3. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear their session and show login/register buttons
4. WHEN navigation state is uncertain THEN the system SHALL default to showing login/register options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust middleware protection for admin routes, so that server-side security is enforced regardless of client-side behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to admin routes THEN the middleware SHALL verify authentication and authorization server-side
2. WHEN an unauthorized request is made to admin routes THEN the middleware SHALL return a 401 or 403 status code
3. WHEN authentication tokens are invalid or expired THEN the middleware SHALL reject the request
4. WHEN admin routes are accessed without proper credentials THEN the system SHALL log the security event for monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper role-based access control, so that users can only access features appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's role is verified THEN the system SHALL only display navigation and features appropriate to that role
2. WHEN a user attempts to access features above their permission level THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect appropriately
3. WHEN user roles change THEN the system SHALL immediately update the available features and navigation
4. WHEN role verification fails THEN the system SHALL default to the most restrictive access level
