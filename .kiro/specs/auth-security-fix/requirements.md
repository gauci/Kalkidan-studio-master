# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the user experience of the authentication system for Kalkidan e.V., while maintaining the robust security architecture already implemented. The current system has good security features but suffers from confusing branding, redirect issues, and complex error messages that make it difficult for the 200 community members to use. The goal is to keep the security robustness while making the system simple and intuitive to use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a community member, I want a clear and simple login process that works reliably, so that I can quickly access my member dashboard without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the login page THEN the system SHALL show "Kalkidan Member Login" instead of "CMS Login"
2. WHEN I successfully log in THEN the system SHALL redirect me directly to my member dashboard (/dashboard) instead of CMS routes
3. WHEN I register as a new member THEN the system SHALL complete registration and redirect me to login with a success message
4. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL show clear, helpful error messages without technical jargon

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a community member, I want my dashboard to load quickly and show relevant information, so that I can easily access community features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in as a member THEN the system SHALL show me a dashboard with my profile, recent news, and file access
2. WHEN I navigate the site THEN the system SHALL show me clear, member-appropriate navigation
3. WHEN I click logout THEN the system SHALL log me out reliably and return me to the homepage
4. WHEN my session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect me to login with a clear message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want separate admin access that doesn't interfere with the member experience, so that I can manage content without confusing regular members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in as an admin THEN the system SHALL give me the option to access admin features or member dashboard
2. WHEN I access admin features THEN the system SHALL show admin-specific navigation and tools
3. WHEN I switch between admin and member views THEN the system SHALL maintain my session but change the interface
4. WHEN regular members try to access admin areas THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their member dashboard

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the authentication to work reliably with the existing security features, so that I can focus on community activities rather than technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the login form THEN the system SHALL process my credentials using the existing robust validation but with user-friendly messages
2. WHEN I register THEN the system SHALL create my account using the existing security features but with a smooth user experience
3. WHEN there are login issues THEN the system SHALL show clear, helpful error messages instead of technical security messages
4. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL maintain security while providing helpful guidance to users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a community organization, we want to maintain the robust security features while making them transparent to users, so that members can easily participate in community activities without security barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN members log in THEN the system SHALL use the existing security features (rate limiting, validation, etc.) but hide complexity from users
2. WHEN admin functions are accessed THEN the system SHALL use the existing role verification but with clearer user interfaces
3. WHEN there are security events THEN the system SHALL continue logging them but show user-friendly messages to members
4. WHEN the system detects issues THEN it SHALL use existing security measures while providing helpful guidance to users
